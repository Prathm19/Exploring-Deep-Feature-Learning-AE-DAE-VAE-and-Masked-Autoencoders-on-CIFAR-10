# Exploring-Deep-Feature-Learning-AE-DAE-VAE-and-Masked-Autoencoders-on-CIFAR-10
I developed a deep learning project on CIFAR-10 using AE, DAE, VAE, and MCAE to learn image representations. Models were evaluated on reconstruction quality and latent space analysis. The project includes visualizations, denoising, interpolation, and feature extraction for classification.
